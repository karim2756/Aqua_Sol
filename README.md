## 💡 Project Idea

Modern agriculture faces challenges such as water scarcity, crop diseases, and inefficient energy usage. Aqua Sol addresses these issues by enhancing traditional **pivot irrigation systems** with smart technologies.

> **Pivot irrigation** is a method of crop irrigation in which equipment rotates around a pivot and crops are watered with sprinklers. It’s widely used in large-scale farming.

## 🔧 What We Built

Aqua Sol is a fully integrated system combining hardware, AI, automation, solar energy, and mobile technology. It provides farmers with real-time insights and control over their irrigation process, making agriculture more sustainable and productive.

Key features of the system include:

- 💧 **Automated Irrigation Control**  
  The system uses real-time soil moisture data to automatically turn irrigation on or off, optimizing water use and reducing human intervention.

- 📱 **Remote Monitoring via Mobile App**  
  Farmers can monitor and control the pump, pivot motor, and view sensor data right from their phone.

- 📷 **Camera Integration for Crop Monitoring**  
  A real-time camera feed helps detect plant health issues using AI.

- ☀️ **Solar-Powered Hardware**  
  Sustainable energy makes Aqua Sol ideal for rural/off-grid environments.
